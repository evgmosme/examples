# Examples of My Code

This repository highlights key components of my software development work, showcasing expertise in real-time data processing, system optimization, and managing large-scale datasets.

## High-Performance Trading System

**Problem:** Developing a system that can process real-time data and execute transactions with minimal latency is crucial in high-frequency environments, but these principles apply to any system requiring real-time processing and low-latency operations.  
**Solution:** Built an event-driven framework where different modules communicate through a centralized event queue, allowing the system to process live data streams and execute transactions within 5 milliseconds. This approach demonstrates strong skills in designing scalable, high-performance systems.

## RealTimeDataHandler

**Problem:** Managing and processing continuous streams of data while ensuring that the system remains efficient and responsive.  
**Solution:** Created a `RealTimeDataHandler` to stream, process, and efficiently retain data for multiple sources, using memory optimization techniques such as data retention policies. This design ensures that the system can scale and handle large volumes of data without sacrificing performance, which is critical in any data-intensive application.

## OrderExecutionHandler

**Problem:** Building a reliable and flexible order execution system that can handle multiple order types and integrate seamlessly with external APIs.  
Solution: Developed an `OrderExecutionHandler` that interacts with external APIs to execute various order types while ensuring real-time confirmation and logging. The systemâ€™s design ensures reliability and accuracy, which is essential for any application that relies on external service integration, not just trading platforms.

## Cointegration Analysis Notebook

**Problem:** Analyzing large datasets efficiently to extract meaningful insights, which is a common requirement across many fields.  
**Solution:** Designed a data analysis notebook that processes over 6,000 stock symbols to identify statistically significant relationships using random sampling and multiprocessing. This approach effectively balances computational efficiency with rigorous data analysis, demonstrating the ability to handle and analyze large-scale data across different contexts.
