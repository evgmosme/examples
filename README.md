# Examples of My Code

This repository highlights key components of my software development and data anlytics works, showcasing expertise in real-time data processing, machine learning, system optimization, data engineering, and managing large-scale datasets.

## High-Performance Trading System

A couple words about the system i've developed.

This trading system is an advanced algorithmic platform designed for real-time, high-frequency trading, leveraging a robust, event-driven architecture. It efficiently processes live market data, executes trades, and manages portfolios with minimal latency (5 milliseconds per trade). The systemâ€™s core components include a data handler for asynchronous data streaming, a statistical arbitrage strategy for generating trading signals based on statistical models, an execution handler for executing orders via the broker API, and a portfolio manager that dynamically adjusts positions based on real-time data. With concurrency and parallelism at its foundation, the system ensures rapid response to market conditions, making it highly scalable and resilient for high-frequency trading environments. Comprehensive logging and modular design further enhance its maintainability and performance.

## RealTimeDataHandler (real_time_data_handler.py)

This component of my algorithmic trading system is designed to automate and manage real-time trading. The class handles the streaming, processing, and retention of financial data for various symbols using the Alpaca API. It addresses the problem of ensuring that live market data is efficiently collected and integrated with recent historical data, allowing for accurate and timely decision-making. By running in a separate thread, it maintains the system's responsiveness, ensuring that the trading strategy can react to market changes without delay. The class also updates the portfolio with the latest market conditions and triggers market events when enough data is gathered, enabling the system to make informed trading decisions automatically.

## OrderExecutionHandler (order_execution_handler.py)

This class, iis designed to automate and manage the execution of trades in real-time using the Alpaca API. It solves the problem of ensuring that various types of trading orders (market, limit, stop-limit) are executed accurately and efficiently without human intervention. By managing real-time trade updates through a WebSocket connection, it ensures that trades are processed as soon as they occur, keeping the trading strategy responsive to market conditions. The class also maintains system reliability by automatically reconnecting to the trade stream if the connection is lost and logs trade details for auditing and analysis, addressing the challenges of continuous operation in a dynamic trading environment.

## Cointegration Analysis Notebook (cointegrated_pairs.ipynb)

The Jupyter notebook provides an optimized solution for identifying stock pairs suitable for statistical arbitrage by focusing on efficient cointegration analysis. It addresses the challenge of processing massive financial datasets, filtering stocks based on specific criteria like price and volume, and applying the Cointegration Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test to detect pairs with a stable, mean-reverting relationship. By leveraging multiprocessing and random sampling, the notebook significantly reduces computational time, making it feasible to analyze large datasets and identify cointegrated pairs for use in high-performance trading strategies.

## Daily Data Pipelne (airflow_daily_data_pipeline.py)

The script is implemented as an Apache Airflow DAG, to automate the processing and analysis of financial market data using the Alpaca API. It fetches historical market data and trade quotes, inserts them into a PostgreSQL database, and calculates key technical indicators like resistance levels. The pipeline also aggregates quote data into metrics such as average spread and volume imbalance. By orchestrating these tasks in sequence and leveraging parallel processing, the system efficiently handles large datasets, ensuring that clean, organized data is ready for use in trading strategies.
