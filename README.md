# Examples of My Code

This repository showcases critical components of my current algorithmic trading system, focusing on solving specific challenges within algorithmic trading.

## Algorithmic Trading System

**Problem:** Executing real-time algorithmic trading strategies efficiently requires a robust architecture to handle live data and quickly submit orders. 
**Solution:** The system is built on an event-driven framework where data handlers, strategy engines, and execution handlers communicate through a centralized event queue. This design enables the processing of live data and the submission of orders to the broker in approximately 5 milliseconds, ensuring quick and accurate trade execution.

## RealTimeDataHandler

**Problem:** Ensuring that the most current market data is available for strategy evaluation while managing incoming data efficiently.
**Solution:** The RealTimeDataHandler streams, processes, and retains real-time data for multiple financial symbols, applying retention policies to manage memory usage. This approach guarantees that up-to-date information is always accessible, enabling informed and timely trading decisions.

## OrderExecutionHandler

**Problem:** Executing various types of trades in real-time and ensuring accurate logging for auditing and analysis.
**Solution:** The AlpacaExecutionHandler interfaces with Alpaca's API to place different types of orders (market, limit, stop-limit) and handles trade confirmations through WebSocket streams. This ensures that trade signals are executed efficiently, with all trading activities logged for later review.

## Cointegration Analysis Notebook

**Problem:** Identifying stock pairs that exhibit stable, mean-reverting relationships for statistical arbitrage strategies, particularly in a large dataset.
**Solution:** The Cointegration Analysis Script filters over 6,000 stock symbols based on specific criteria and applies the Cointegration Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test to randomly selected periods. This approach efficiently identifies potentially profitable pairs for trading, balancing computational efficiency with rigorous analysis.
