# Examples of My Code

This repository highlights key components of my software development and data anlytics works, showcasing expertise in real-time data processing, machine learning, system optimization, data engineering, and managing large-scale datasets.

## High-Performance Trading System

**Problem:** Developing a system that can process real-time data and execute transactions with minimal latency is crucial in high-frequency environments, but these principles apply to any system requiring real-time processing and low-latency operations. 

**Solution:** Built an event-driven framework where different modules communicate through a centralized event queue, allowing the system to process live data streams and execute transactions within 5 milliseconds. This approach demonstrates strong skills in designing scalable, high-performance systems.

## RealTimeDataHandler

**Problem:** Managing and processing continuous streams of data while ensuring that the system remains efficient and responsive.  

**Solution:** Created a `RealTimeDataHandler` to stream, process, and efficiently retain data for multiple sources, using memory optimization techniques such as data retention policies. This design ensures that the system can scale and handle large volumes of data without sacrificing performance, which is critical in any data-intensive application.

## OrderExecutionHandler

**Problem:** Building a reliable and flexible order execution system that can handle multiple order types and integrate seamlessly with external APIs.  

**Solution:**  Developed an `OrderExecutionHandler` that interacts with external APIs to execute various order types while ensuring real-time confirmation and logging. The systemâ€™s design ensures reliability and accuracy, which is essential for any application that relies on external service integration, not just trading platforms.

## Cointegration Analysis Notebook

**Problem:** Efficiently identifying statistically significant stock pairs for trading within a large dataset. 

**Solution:** Developed a script that filters over 6,000 stock symbols and applies the Cointegration Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test to random samples, identifying potentially profitable pairs. This approach balances computational efficiency with rigorous analysis

## Daily Data Pipelne

**Problem:** Efficiently processing and analyzing large volumes of financial market data in real-time to derive actionable insights is essential for effective trading strategies. Managing the entire lifecycle of market data processing, from data acquisition, analysis to insertion to the database, requires robust infrastructure and scalable solutions.

**Solution:** Developed a high-performance DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in Apache Airflow to automate the fetching, processing, and analysis of 30-minute bar data from the Alpaca API. The pipeline is designed to handle data for thousands of financial symbols in parallel, calculate key market indicators, and insert the processed data into a PostgreSQL database. It includes several stages such as data retrieval, calculation of resistance levels, and aggregation of trade quotes, all optimized for large-scale data processing. This solution demonstrates strong capabilities in data pipeline orchestration, parallel processing, and the integration of real-time data into scalable databases.
